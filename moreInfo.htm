     First of all, hello, <span class="highlighted-content">I'm Saeed</span>, <span class="highlighted-content">20 years old</span>. I love computers in general and programming in particular. I'm in my third year as a university student <span class="highlighted-content">majoring in computers at the College of Specific Education</span>. I have a fair amount of experience in several programming fields, but especially in the field of <span class="highlighted-content">front-end developer</span>. I hope one day to be influential in this field, even to the extent possible. Simple, that's why I created this website to encourage me to continue with my goal and to pass on what I learned to you.</p>

          <p class="main-paragraph-content">The internet is a vast interconnected network that has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and live. Before diving further into frontend development, it's essential to grasp the foundational concepts of how the internet functions.

          This foundational knowledge encompasses understanding domains, the Domain Name System (DNS), servers, and protocols like HTTP/HTTPS. Additionally, a basic comprehension of web browsers, their role, and how they render web pages is crucial for anyone looking to venture into web development.</p>

        <dt><li>JS</li></dt>
        <dd class="list-caption">JavaScript breathes life into static web pages. It's a dynamic programming language that introduces interactivity, making websites more engaging and user-centric.</dd>

        <dd class="list-caption">To maximize your productivity as a developer, it's important to understand how to use large language models, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and others. A knowledge of prompt engineering will help you understand how to get the most helpful responses from large language models.</dd>
        <dt><li>Package Managers</li></dt>
        <dd class="list-caption">As projects grow and evolve, managing software libraries and dependencies can become a challenge. Package managers are tools designed to address this challenge.</dd>

     <p class="more-info-main-paragraph">
     in the world of software development, tracking and managing changes is crucial. This is where version control systems, particularly <span class="highlighted-content">Git</span>, come into play. Git allows developers to track changes, collaborate seamlessly, and revert to previous versions if needed. on the other hand theres a platforms that hosts Git repositories, fasilitating collaboration, code sharing, even deployment.

     <p class="more-info-main-paragraph">
     Simply put, we love Linux because Linux is you, I'm not going to talk about the usual things like it's open source noise and it's safe etc. Just if you go into this world and enjoy your own experience, you'll find yourself locked into that delicate monster called Windows. Don't let's talk harder about Linux. The best operating system that can benefit you Being a programmer will tell you more about what programming languages are and how they work. Not only will you know more about operating systems and how they work.It will allow you to experience the most things you will regret that you have never known and will expand your horizons further and will develop the skill of how you think as a programmer and many more, <span class="highlighted-content">Linux just works.</span>

Vim, short for Vi IMproved, is highly configurable text editor built to enable officient text editing. it's an enhanced version of the Vi editor, which was developed back in the 1970s. Vim is widely used by programmers, system administrators, and anyone who spends a significant of time working in the terminal.</dd>
          <dt><li><strong>Basics</strong>of Command Line Interface (CLI)</li></dt>
          <dd class="list-caption">A command line interface (CLI) is a software mechanism you use to interact with your operating system using your keyboard. Another mechanism is a graphical UI (GUI), which is popular today with all applications and software systems. You can use a GUI to visually navigate and click on icons and images to make things work. However, a GUI is inefficient for system administration tasks, especially if the environment is virtual or remote. With a command line interface, you can enter text commands to configure, navigate, or run programs on any server or computer system. All operating systems—including Linux, macOS, and Windows—provide a CLI for faster system interaction.</dd>
          <dt><li>Bash Scripting (<strong>Fundamentals</strong>)</li></dt>
          <dd class="list-caption">A bash script is a file containing a sequence of commands that are executed by the bash program line by line. It allows you to perform a series of actions, such as navigating to a specific directory, creating a folder, and launching a process using the command line.
